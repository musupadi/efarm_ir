#  eFarm IR â€“ Multimodal Information Retrieval System for Milk Price Mapping

This repository hosts a lightweight **multimodal information retrieval (IR) system** for dairy price mapping. Built with `Streamlit`, the system supports real-time price extraction from **text**, **image (OCR)**, and **audio (STT)**, combining **TF-IDF** and **TinyBERT** in a fusion architecture. It also includes automatic evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy) for every query.

>  **Use case**: Helping farmers and cooperatives in low-resource areas access transparent milk pricing using various input types.
